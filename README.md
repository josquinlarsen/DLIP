DLIP - Designing Low-Level Input/Output Procedures 

DLIP prompts user for 10 signed (+/-) integers (read as strings); validates that the user input is indeed a signed integer that can fit within an SDWORD [-2147483648d, 2147483647d] then displays array of user's valid input; calculates and displays the sum of the valid input; and finally calculates and displays the truncated average of the value (e.g. 3.33 = 3). 

DLIP invokes macros to receive and display input and to display all strings. Procedures are used to convert strings (ASCII) to integers; perform calculations; and reconvert integers back to strings for display to the console.
